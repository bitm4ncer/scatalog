### Labels deserve their own Spotify page
Music discovery should be about exploration and connection — not strategic platform restrictions.\
The current model of commercially curated playlists and biased algorithms actively prohibits indie labels and niche projects from beeing dicovered by their audience.\
Independent labels are the driving force behind genre innovation and musical diversity. They deserve to be found.
