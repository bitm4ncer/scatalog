Music discovery should be about exploration and connection, not algorithmic limitations. 

- Browse complete label catalogs 
- Discover new artists through label connections  
- *Explore the rich ecosystem of independent music*


**Independent labels have been the driving force** behind genre innovation and musical diversity throughout history. Countless musical styles and movements have originated from these independent labels, who operate outside the mainstream spotlight of curated playlists, algorithmic recommendations and major label contracts.
